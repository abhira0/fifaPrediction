2. Download the each and every file from the rep.
3. Run the r files in sequence:
    * "0_clean.r"-> will produce partially cleansed data named "0_raw_downloaded_data.csv"
    * "1_cleaning_data.r" -> will produce completely cleaned data "1_cleaned_data.csv"
    * "2_norm_stand.r" -> will produce different normalized csv files
    * "3_visualization.r" -> will give you the visualization
    * "4_correlation.r" -> does as the name says
    * "5_hypothesis_testing.r" -> does as the name says
    * "6_regression.r" -> does as the name says
